//NOTES: idea behind test driven development is that we are incrementally adding to the function. Our test should be v exhaustive that at end, the only way to reasonably solve the problem of the function is by having function do what it is intended to do. TODAY, we are practicing how to write tests. NOT DOING: writing functions for tests. David tip: In assessment, just solve problem.
